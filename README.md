# BIGHUG'S CHATBOT

The proposed chatbot has been developed for research purposes and is accompanied by a website that aims to gamify its use. 
The chatbot based system tries to engage young people in the awareness of mental disorders. The chatbot employs a dialogue engine that combines both close and open conversations. By doing this, the chatbot can send specific controlled messages to steer the conversation towards a particular mental disorder. This focus will be updated over time to keep the content fresh and engaging. After a set of initial trial questions are asked and answered, the chatbot will initiate a conversation on the targeted mental disorder. This conversation will be tailored to the user's sensitivity to that disorder.
Finally, the chatbot will engage the user in an open conversation based on the GPT-3 language model. This will enable the user to express themselves more freely and openly, facilitating a more natural and personalized experience.
